# Test notes

## External libs used

- TimSort: to improve data sorting speed
- Date-fns: to allow better date comparison 

## Areas for improvement

- Performance improvements reading 8000+ records
- Sort indicators should indicate what is the current sort order and rotate accordingly in the UI
- Ideally table should be paginated - but that would most likely mean backend pagination & sorting
- Design improvements such as mobile designs etc.
